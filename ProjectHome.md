This project aims to design and develop a platform for the evaluation of secure routing protocols  in Wireless Sensor Networks,  within the framework of the elaboration of a master's thesis.
It is intended that the platform has the following features:

1. API for modeling secure algorithms

2. Graphical interface for reading the results of important parameters with eg power consumption, reliability, coverage of the network.

3. Modeling types of attacks, programming of malicious sensors behavior  and measuring the  impacts on the parameters mentioned above.

4. Implementing a graphical environment for viewing the network, information associated with each node.

**ATTENTION**

This project is currently hosted in http://code.google.com/p/secwsnsim/ because its name was changed to Wisenet Simulator. When this project is at a later stage will be migrated to here ..
